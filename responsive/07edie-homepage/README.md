## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirilKaloyanov/DevChallenges/main/responsive/07edie-homepage/screenshot.png)

With this challenge I spent most time making the drop-down menu for small screens. I learned that even if I give a container a zero height, the text nodes inside stil have a height unless I style them explicitly as well. I dynamically add and remove the transition class with JS in order to escape from having the transition when changing the screen width.
