## Overview

The challenge with this design was to animate the drop of the menu on small screen so it gradually slide downwards. The problem came from the fact that when the height of the menu container was set to 0 it still took space on the page as the display is flex used to set the content in the middle of the page. Another property needed animation and I chose to transform with scaleY function to smash the content to 0 and hide it from the page. With proper fine-tuning of the transition times the effect of sliding up and down was found.
